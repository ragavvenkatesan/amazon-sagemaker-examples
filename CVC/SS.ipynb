    "[Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) is a popular computer vision dataset which is used for annual semantic segmentation challenges from 2005 to 2012.

Examples of the segmentation dataset can be seen in the [Pascal VOC Dataset page](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/segexamples/index.html). The classes are as follows:\n",

Then, the data from our channels are downloaded into the instance. Once this is done, the training job begins. The provisioning and data downloading will take time, depending on the size of the data and the availability of the type of instances. Therefore it might be a few minutes before we start getting data logs for our training jobs. The data logs will also print out training loss on the training data, which is the pixel-wise cross-entropy loss as described in the algorithm papers. The data logs will also print out pixel-wise label accuracy and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on the validation data after a run of the dataset once or one epoch.
